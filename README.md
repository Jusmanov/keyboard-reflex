# keyboard-reflex
This is a game with a text-based interface in which the user must press the key that shows up on the screen as fast as they can. Tracks user score and response time. Essentially a test of reflexes.

Curses is a library intended for creating text-based interfaces (e.g. terminal emulators), and it was used heavily in this 58-line game. I wanted to learn how to use this library and learn its basic functions, hence the game is very minimal in essence and is only intended for basic functionality. The time, random, and string libraries were also used for this game. I have no plans on updating this project whatsoever, although I am one step closer to learning how to create good text-based interfaces with the Python language.
